# music-suite

This is a meta-library that imports the [Music Suite](http://music-suite.github.io/).

It allows users to install all (stable) libraries in the suite as follows:

    cabal install music-suite
    
If you wish to install an experimental package, simply use `cabal install` on the specific package instead.
